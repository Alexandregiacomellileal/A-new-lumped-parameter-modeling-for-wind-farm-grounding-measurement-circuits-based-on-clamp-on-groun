A new lumped parameter modeling to evaluate the low-frequency performance of wind farm grounding systems

This is the file folder for the article titled: A new lumped parameter modeling to evaluate the low-frequency performance of wind farm grounding systems
, recently submitted to the Electrical Power Systems Research journal (ELSEVIER).

This article addresses the impact of mutual impedance between grounding elements in measuring the grounding resistance of wind turbines using
the clamp-on ground meter. Furthermore, it proposes a new lumped parameter model for wind farm grounding to include the representation of such effects.
In this study, turbine ground resistance readings in a typical wind farm are taken by computer simulation using lumped parameter modeling and electromagnetic
field modeling. Taking the electromagnetic model as standard, the results demonstrate that the proposed solution was able to accurately estimate
the performance of a wind farm grounding system.
